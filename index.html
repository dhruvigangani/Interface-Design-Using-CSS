            <p>You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head</p>
            <p>Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head</p>
            <p>Five days on the freeway</p>
            <p>Riding shotgun with you (yeah, yeah)</p>
            <p>Two hearts in the fast lane</p>
            <p>We had big dreams in blue (yeah, yeah)</p>
            <p>Playing Sweet Child O' Mine</p>
            <p>And I still feel that line</p>
            <p>Where are you now?</p>
            <p>Where are you now?</p>
            <p>Hey, it's been too long</p>
            <p>Too long to go, my love</p>
            <p>Where did we go wrong?</p>
            <p>Too late to turn around</p>
            <p>Where are you now?</p>

            <p>One day you gotta come through</p>
            <p>Lost in these city lights</p>
            <p>'Cause I can't sleep tonight</p>
            <p>Where are you now?</p>
            <p>Where are you now?</p>
